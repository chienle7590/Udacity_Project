# Identify customer segments with Arvato

This project is a part of Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. In this project AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions have provided two datasets one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. We apply unsupervised learning techniques on demographic and spending data for a sample of German households. We preprocess the data, apply dimensionality reduction techniques, and implement clustering algorithms to segment customers with the goal of optimizing customer outreach for a mail order company.

We look at relationships between demographics features, organize the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained.

We are not allowed to publish the data provided by Arvato Financial Services due to the terms and conditions. In the notebook you can find the code and the analysis that I perfomed on the datasets.
